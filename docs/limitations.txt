Compatibility
=============

.. NOTE::

   We recommend that you use the version of Crash that is bundled with the
   version of CrateDB that you are using. This minimises the chances of
   compatibility issues.

CrateDB tries to maintain `backwards`_ and `forwards`_ compatibility. However,
this is not always possible.

Known compatibility issues:

- Due to `information schema`_ changes, Crash versions 0.19 and earlier
  are not compatible with CrateDB versions 0.57 and later.

- For CrateDB versions 0.38.x and earlier, it is not possible to insert nested
  arrays or nested objects via Crash. You must use `CrateDB REST endpoint`_ or a
  `client library`_.

  CrateDB versions 0.39 and later allow you to insert nested arrays using
  `array constructors`_, and nested objects using `object literals`_.
