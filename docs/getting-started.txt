Getting Started
===============

Crash is bundled with CrateDB so there is typically no need to install it
yourself.

.. TIP::

   For manual installation instructions, consult the `PyPI overview`_.

If you are able to run the ``crate`` command, you should be able to run the
``crash`` command. Both of these executable files live inside the main CrateDB
`bin` directory.

If the CrateDB ``bin`` directory is on your `PATH`_, you can start Crash like
so::

  sh$ crash

Otherwise, locate the CrateDB directory, and run it like so::

  sh$ ./bin/crash

When ``crash`` is run without any additional arguments, it will attempt to
connect to ``localhost:4200``. To connect to another host, use the ``--hosts``
flag. For example::

  sh$ crash --host 198.51.100.1

If you are experiencing a connection error, try the ``--verbose`` flag::

  sh$ crash --verbose

When run with ``--verbose``, Crash will print useful information about
what it is doing to `STDOUT`_. This includes connection attempts and full stack
traces in the case of an error.

.. TIP::

   For more help, see :ref:`run`.
