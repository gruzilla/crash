Prerequisites
=============

Recent versions of Crash require Python 3 (>= 3.4) to run.

Use Crash version 0.23.x if you are running Python 2.7 or 3.3.

Use Crash version 0.16.x if you're running Python 2.6.

Installation
============

Under normal circumstances, you do not have to manually install Crash.

Crash is bundled with CrateDB.

If you are able to run the ``crate`` command, you should be able to run the
``crash`` command (either from the same ``bin`` directory, or on your `PATH`_).

The following instructions should only be followed if you specifically want to
install Crash separately from CrateDB.

As a Python Package
-------------------

Crash is available as a pip_ package.

To install, run::

    $ pip install crash

Now, run it::

    $ crash

To update, run::

    $ pip install -U crash

If you are not using Python version 3.4 or above, recent version of pip_ will
only install version 0.23.x. This is because newer versions of this package are
not compatible with Python 2.7 or 3.3 and below.

Standalone
----------

Crash is also available as a standalone executable that includes all the
necessary dependencies, and can be run as long as Python (>= 3.4) is available.

First, download the executable::

    $ curl -o crash https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/releases/crash_standalone_latest

Then, make it executable::

    $ chmod +x crash

Now, run it::

    $ ./crash

If you would like to run ``crash`` from any directory and without using leading
``./`` you will need to move it to somewhere on your ``$PATH``.

Legacy Versions
...............

For Python 2.7 and 3.3 please download version ``0.23.0`` from the CDN::

    $ curl -o crash https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/releases/crash_standalone_0.23.0

For Python 2.6 please download version ``0.16.2`` from the CDN::

    $ curl -o crash https://cdn.crate.io/downloads/releases/crash_standalone_0.16.2

Usage
=====

For usage information and options, run::

    $ crash --help
